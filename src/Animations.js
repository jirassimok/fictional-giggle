/**
 * Class tracking state of each animation (translation, rotation, and explosion)
 *
 * The current animation state is stored in the variable {@code animationState},
 * which should be the only instance of this class. Do not attempt to save
 * references to its value, as it will change when the state is reset.
 *
 * Explosion and rotation are represented as pausable timers that increase while
 * the animations are running.
 *
 * The translations are represented as bi-directional timers that increase for
 * positive motion and decrease for negative motion.
 *
 * The animations' effects are determined by functions of the timers' values in
 * {@link drawMesh}.
 *
 * @property {AnimationTracer} xrotation State of rotation around X-axis
 *
 * @property {ReversableTimer} xtranslation difference between time spent moving
 *                                          in positive and negative X direction
 * @property {ReversableTimer} ytranslation difference between time spent moving
 *                                          in positive and negative Y direction
 * @property {ReversableTimer} ztranslation difference between time spent moving
 *                                          in positive and negative Z direction
